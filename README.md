# Searching-a-substring-in-Java-All-occurrences

Given two strings, a pattern and a text. Write a program that counts the number of times the pattern occurs in the text and prints indexes of all occurrences.

Input: two strings, a pattern and a text, each is on a separate line. It is guaranteed that the length of the text is always greater than 00.

Output: the first line should contain the number of times the pattern occurs in the text. The second line should contain all indexes of occurrences separated by space.

Keep in mind that the empty string is a substring for any string. See the second test case as an example of how an empty pattern should be processed.
